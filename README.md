# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game with versus player and versus AI modes

## Current Status

Currently just starting this project (If you look at this right now it will be a mess!). I wanted to work with making a game, making an AI, and attempting a display with pygame rather than command line. 

## TODO

* Implement AI Play Method
  * Different Difficulties
    * Easy = Random
    * Hard = Minimax
 
* Change over Command Line UI to Pygame UI
  * Display game
  * Mouse click for move choices
  * Full screen / windowed
  * Change background colors?
